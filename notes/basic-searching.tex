\title{Searching a Database}
\author{James Condron}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this we shall learn how to connect to our database, search for data and figure out what does what.
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Connecting}
We use the mysql command; we can give it a username, a password and a database name as per: \\

{\tt mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASE } \\

By specifying '-p' without giving a password asks us for our password. So: \\

{\tt mysql -ueli -p our\_game\_company } \\

Will connect you to our database and ask for your password. \\

At this point use the command \\

{\tt show tables } \\

To see what tables we have in our database. You can see what each of these tables looks like with: \\

{\tt describe table\_name } \\

\subsection{Searching}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many scoring games have been played? (Hint: use  {\tt select count(*)} )
\item How many people have signed up with {\tt hotmail.com} accounts?
\item Which username is alphabetically first in our database?
\item How many users do we have from Albania?
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Extra Credit}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Why would we use {\tt count} to count rows?
\item How does doing a {\tt select} on a single column compare to doing a {\tt select *} ?
\end{enumerate}
