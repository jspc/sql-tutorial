\begin{abstract}
This session we're going to add data to our database, replace data to our database and maybe do some shit.
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Constraints}

To see our constraints we can use our old friend {\tt describe table\_name}:

\begin{verbatim}
mysql> describe users;
+----------+-------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type              | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+-------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| username | varchar(32)       | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| city     | tinytext          | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| country  | tinytext          | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| sex      | enum('M','F','N') | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| email    | varchar(256)      | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| signup   | datetime          | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+-------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Inserting}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new game (Hint: the date will be {\tt 2013-07-04})
\item Try and create the same game again with a different description. What happens?
\item Order the users table by city, take the first one, and set that user's score on the new game to 9999
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Updating}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many users from United Kingdom wont tell us their sex?
\item Lets assume they're all actually women. Set them as women. How many rows does it update?
\item There has been a military coup in Egypt and the country has been renamed to `Gaytopia'. How many rows does changing this update?
\item Uh-oh! The crazy French have invaded Germany and taken it over! Better update this. How many French users do we have now?
\end{enumerate}
